## Data Analyst

## A bit about me...
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a Data Analyst based in Milton Keynes, UK. 

My passion for data started when I was introduced to PowerBI reports to enable me achieve key customer requirements, and I haven't looked back since. My biggest motivation is to get better everyday at what i love doing. 

You can find out more about that further down the page...
